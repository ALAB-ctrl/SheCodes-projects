        The famously long, low silhouette, ever-alert expression, and bold, vivacious personality of the <strong>Dachshund</strong> have made him a superstar of the canine kingdom. 
        Dachshunds come in two sizes and in three coat types of various colors and patterns.  
        Dachshunds can be <span class="description"> standard-sized (usually 16 to 32 pounds) </span> or <span class="description"> miniature (11 pounds or under)</span> , and come in one of <span class="description"> three coat types: smooth, wirehaired, or longhaired. </span> 
        Dachshunds aren't built for distance running, leaping, or strenuous swimming, but otherwise these tireless hounds are game for anything. 
        Smart and vigilant, with a big-dog bark, they make fine watchdogs. 
        Bred to be an independent hunter of dangerous prey, they can be brave to the point of rashness, and a bit stubborn, but their endearing nature and unique look has won millions of hearts the world over.
